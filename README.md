# Virtual Assistant Portfolio – Ralph Ryan Lizada

Hello! I’m **Ralph Ryan Lizada**, a detail-oriented professional with a strong background in customer service, technical support, and administrative work. While I don’t have formal Virtual Assistant experience, I’ve been assisting a close friend working as a VA by handling real tasks for nearly two years — especially during their time off. This gave me valuable hands-on exposure to remote administrative work.

I began my professional journey as a **Customer Service Representative from December 2019 to June 2021**, where I developed strong communication, multitasking, and client handling skills. Afterward, I gained experience in production-related roles before transitioning back into customer-focused work.

Currently, I work at **Foundever** as a **Technical Support, Sales Support, and Customer Service Representative**, assisting customers with product concerns and supporting internal sales operations. On top of that, I serve as the **auditor in our church**, creating and maintaining **financial reports using Microsoft Excel** — proving my skills in reporting, documentation, and using office tools.
